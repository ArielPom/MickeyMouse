The field of robotics has been advancing rapidly in recent years. Fast and compact computers, inexpensive electronic and mechanical components, and advanced algorithms all enable the development of intelligent robots capable of performing tasks autonomously and efficiently on dedicated robotic platforms.

One of the well-known challenges in robotics is achieving efficient and precise autonomous movement from one point to another using a small robotic platform.

This challenge is reflected in several areas of our lives : in logistics, robots move goods in massive warehouses. In the Home consumer market, A wide range of autonomous vacuum cleaners is available in a wide price range. And in the defense industry There is a growing presence of drones and small robots capable of conducting missions autonomously.

In this project, we present a solution to this challenge with a small robotic platform that utilizes wheels, a range sensor, and a camera to efficiently reach a target point while identifying and avoiding obstacles.
